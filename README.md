## SQL-Challenge

### Introduction

Data engineering and Database project that involves designing database tables to accommodate the data, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and conducting data analysis to extract insights. The data is employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s and consists of six CSV files.  The aim is to create an effective database schema, import data accurately, and derive valuable information from the database.
